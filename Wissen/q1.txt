You have two bottles: one that can hold exactly 3 liters of water and another that can hold exactly 5 liters.

Your goal is to measure out precisely 4 liters of water using only these two bottles, with no additional measuring devices or markings available on the bottles.
You can fill the bottles to their full capacity, empty them completely, or pour water from one bottle to the other until one is full or the other is empty.

Step 1: Fill the 5-liter container from the tap.

Step 2: Pour the 5 liters into the 3-liter container until it's full, leaving 2 liters in the 5-liter container.

Step 3: Empty the 3-liter container.

Step 4: Pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter container into the 3-liter container.

Step 5: Fill the 5-liter container again.

Step 6: Pour water from the 5-liter container into the 3-liter container until it's full. Since only 1 liter was needed, the 5-liter container will be left with 4 liters of water.

This is the best approach with the least number of steps to measure the water in the container to be exact, 4 liters.

We can measure 4 liters using another approach, which we will be discussing below.
