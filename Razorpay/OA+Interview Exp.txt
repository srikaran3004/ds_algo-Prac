🔹 Round 1 – Online Assessment (90 mins)
 ✅ 3 DSA questions + 10–15 MCQs (covering DSA, OOPS, DBMS, Aptitude)
 ✅ Completed everything in ~70 minutes
 DSA Questions:
 1️⃣ Dijkstra’s Algorithm (with minimal changes)
 2️⃣ Special Number using Digit DP
 3️⃣ LRU Cache Implementation using map + doubly linked list

🔹 Round 2 – Technical Interview (45 mins)
 ✅ Asked to solve 2 DSA questions live and explain my approach + complexity
 ✅ Solved both in 35 minutes and discussed optimizations
 DSA Questions:
 1️⃣ Decode String (stack/recursion based)
 2️⃣ Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted (two-pointer approach)

🔹 Round 3 – Hiring Manager Interview (~45 mins)
 ✅ Deep dive into my resume, projects, and prior experience
 ✅ Ended with a riddle, which I solved with minimal hints — finishing the process on a positive note

✨ Key Learnings:
Consistency in DSA practice (especially Graphs, DP, and Arrays) was crucial
Having strong projects on my resume helped me stand out in the HM round
Clear communication of my thought process and optimizations was key in interviews.
